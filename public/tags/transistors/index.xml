      <description>Disassembling an old tape recorder, I found there were tiny bulb structures that didnâ€™t seem to light up (or have tungsten for that matter). Upon research I was surprised to find that there was a time in history where silicon was just sand.&#xA;This was the period of vaccum tubes. This is a creative engineering solution for computing problems.&#xA;The tube consists of two electrodes(as usual) the cathode and anode. The cathode is heated which produces electrons due to a phenomenon called thermionic emission.</description>
