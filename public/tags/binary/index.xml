      <description>Confusion arose when the lights turned on when they were supposed to be off and lit the room blue.&#xA;The LED was connected to pin 18 of the gpio and given an on pulse. But nothing interesting happened. When the off signal was given, the LED started off.&#xA;Upon investigating the problem in the strange waters of the internet, there were a lot of confusing answers and I realized the fact that a basic understanding of how LEDs and gpio works was essential.</description>
