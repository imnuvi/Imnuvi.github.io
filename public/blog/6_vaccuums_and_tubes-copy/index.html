          <p>Disassembling an old tape recorder, I found there were tiny bulb structures that didnâ€™t seem to light up (or have tungsten for that matter). Upon research I was surprised to find that there was a time in history where silicon was just sand.</p>
<p>This was the period of vaccum tubes. This is a creative engineering solution for computing problems.</p>
<p>The tube consists of two electrodes(as usual) the cathode and anode. The cathode is heated which produces electrons due to a phenomenon called thermionic emission. The concept is that metals emit electrons when heated. These electrons reach the anode due to the positive potential at the anode. This creates a currentflow from anode to cathode(electricity flows opposite to electrons).</p>
<p>Thereby it essentially creates a diode (di-electrode??). Diodes conduct in one direction only. This diode was used mainly for rectification of ac to dc.</p>
<p>For transistors, a thurd electrode was installed in between the cathode and anode. This was a metal mesh which was given an external negative supply voltage. This negative voltage repels the electron flow. By controlling the voltage level we can essentially control the circuit current creating a triode.</p>
<p>Triodes are mainly used as amplifiers because they are in essence an electric switch. This triode was also used to construct logic gates.</p>
<p>There was even a variant with four and five electrodes, the two additional eoectrodes called screen grid and suppression grid for further control of electron flow.</p>
<p>The entirety of the tube is kept in vaccum to provide clear paths for the electrons.</p>
<p>Now that, is something to marvel about.</p>
