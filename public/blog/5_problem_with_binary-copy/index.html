          </ul>
          <p>Confusion arose when the lights turned on when they were supposed to be off and lit the room blue.</p>
<p>The LED was connected to pin 18 of the gpio and given an on pulse. But nothing interesting happened. When the off signal was given, the LED started off.</p>
<p>Upon investigating the problem in the strange waters of the internet, there were a lot of confusing answers and I realized the fact that a basic understanding of how LEDs and gpio works was essential.</p>
<p>GPIO input/output pin works by sending a 1 for on pulse and a 0 for off pulse. 1 represents sourcing and 0 represents sinking current. So 1 doesn’t necessarily mean turning the connected device on. It just means a current is sourced.</p>
<p>If the anode of the LED is connected to the I/O port the port can provide only a 12mA current source. This means th LED doesn’t have enough current.</p>
<p>But if the cathode was connected to I/O instead, and the anode to the 3V supply, (more than 20 mA) full brightness can be reached but the configuration is inverted and LED turns on, when the 0 pulse is given and off when the 1 pulse is given.</p>
<p>The best way to adress this boggling issue is to change the configuration in the code from 1 for on, to 0 for on. Although this sounds like a workaraound, truth is, no one cares how it works and just wants to see that light glow</p>
