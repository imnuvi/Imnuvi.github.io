The most annoying thing i had to do in blender was selecting every single edge or corner by myself. Not a hard thing when wwhat you’re designing is small but when its got like 4 subdivision modifiers stuff becomes hard.

So, to select rows of edges or corners that are not even linked but are on the same line, use ctrl + alt + left click

To select alternates from anything you’ve got selected go to the select panel and click checker deselct

Then to select every other linked edge select the edge loops option in select menu.

To select similar stuff, use the select similar option(surprise! surprise!)

This is a great way to select any orientation or edge piece of a heavily subdivided plane on your model

I wish i could remember this, but writing it down seems to etch it to the skull.
