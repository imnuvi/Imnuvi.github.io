Probably one of my favourite way to make eggs, which I stole the recipie from my partner. If anyone ever tries eggs it should be this recipie.

### Ingredients

- Curd: ( Or Greek Yogurt for the English folks )
- Eggs: the main ingredient!
- Chilly or Chilly powder: We will be toasting this with oil.
- Olive oil: although any oil will work.
- Salt and Pepper: To taste.
- Bread

### Process

This is probably the most straightforward processe
- Soft boil the eggs to your preference while preparing a pan to make the chilli oil.
- To soft boil the eggs, bring a pot of water to a boil stage not too rolling but to the point where bubbles are forming.
- Then gently lower the eggs into the pot with a ladle. Prepare a separate bath of cold water to wash and clean the eggs.
- To prepare the chilli oil, pour about 2 teaspoons of olive oil in a pan and once the oil is hot enough, add the chilly flakes or if you don't have flakes add the chilli powder.
- once the oil is ready, remove it to a different bowl and use the same oil to toast the bread ( This makes it taste lovely )
- Once all parts are ready, immerse the eggs in the cold water and break the shells off by lightly breaking them and removing.
- To serve, take a good amquantity of curd in a bowl and cut the boiled eggs on top. Pour the chilly oil over and enjoy with slices of bread!
