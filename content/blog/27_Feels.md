 I write all my content directly without any edits from LLMs. Like, What is the point of making an agent write when you're the only one to whom this matters. With the advent of AI, generating content has become ever easier and I am tired of seeing bot comments on reddit piling up the internet trash. In a direct act of defiance, I am adding real world experiences an AI entity could never experience. Take that AI overlords.
