Palak Paneer is something That I recently stumbled upon. I have always liked Paneer Butter masala but I bought palak without a specific goal and added it, ending up with a good 

### Ingredients

- Large Onion: one and half
- Tomato: two
- Ginger Garlic paste: 2 teaspoons
- Paneer: 500 gms
- spcies: cardamom 2, cloves 2, Bay Leaf 1, cinnamon stick half
- Cream: half a cup
- Palak ( spinach ): about 150 gms
- chillies: 3

### Process

- The first step is to wilt the palak in heat. Rinse the palak in fresh cold water and add 3 cut chillies along with the palak in a pan. Make sure the Palak wilts and the raw smell has vanished.
- Add this to a mixie and blend it thoroughly.
- We will also prepare the paneer by boiling a pan of water and adding the Paneer cubes in to give them the soft and melty texture.
- Next step is to start heating oil in a different pan heating it. Add the flavouring spices in and get them aromatic.
- Add the chopped onions into the oil and heat them till they turn a blushy pink.
- Next add a spoonful of ginger garlic paste and continue sauteing the items.
- Once the mixture turns aromatic, add the chopped tomatoes in and a teaspoon of garam masala while letting it cook for a while till the tomatoes become liquidy.
- At this stage we can also add chicken masala or sambhar masala ( don't @ me, it tastes good ) to enhance the flavour
- Now add the palak mixture we prepared earlier and let it cook for 2 more minutes.
- Finally add a half a cup of cream to get a thick texture.

And, you are done! This is such a simple but amazing recipie that I think everyone should try atleast once. This tastes amazing with chapati or even with dosa.
