We need to start boycotting AI models stealing artist data. We need to make it such that AI can not use data. A platform that only a human can use and experience would be insane. But where does it stop? how do we even define "Experience". 

Humans as inherently clever creatures have always pushed to make our own lives easier, improve productivity and enhancing our existing capabilities. This has been true, since the dawn on the homo erectus, from the crafted hand tools to the spears and bows, the wheel, ships and more recently the rise of machinery and industrialization. Nowhere in this history have we been at such a sophisticated and comfortable state than now, naturally we want to push ourselves further. I like to think of the internet as the future of expanding our processing capacities, we were once siloed in terms of ideas and knowledge sharing and the internet has made this process extremely fast, enabling the entire civilization to act as a whole instead of depending on separate groups.
