"Anything that can go wrong will go wrong." - Edward Murphy

I am well aware of Murphy's law and how it emerges out of pure randomness. But never have I experienced it personally until today.
Being back in School after working was a big shift but I thought I was doing pretty well in everything, except the exams.
I put in more effort, prepared well and thought I had these exams handled.

I have never missed an assignment or class this semester, but today, everything that should not happen happened. I had asked the professor about the exam date and that was registered as the 12th in my mind. I had a bad sleep yesterday and woke up late and decided to skip class this once, as it's the last class. Then I get a mail prom the professor asking me if everything was alright. 
In the stress I took a wrong bus, reached an hour late and did pretty poorly in the exam. Although I know this is not the end of the world, it felt like it for a while and It was interesting to experience it first hand.

Usually when everything goes wrong, I used to have a pretty good understanding of what was not in my control and what is, but this time it felt like everything went wrong and everything could have been handled by me.

Anyways, learnings from this is that checking everything early is a good thing and I need to think more like a schoolkid because it matters.

I like to think of De Morgan's stament of this. - "whatever can happen will happen" and it's up to you to take it however you want.
But it's not an excuse to improve or try your best in every situation.
