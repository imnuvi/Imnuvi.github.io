Why I started skating. How to skate. What I like and how to upgrade your ride.

I have always liked the concept of skating around. When I was very young, me and my brother got a tiny skateboard and a kick scooter which we used to ride around. Even before that, we used to roller skate on a friend's backyard everyday. Then I got a fake version of heelys with pop open wheels and I used to take it everywhere. This made me fall in love with the feeling of rolling around over the years. Out of all the skatey options, I love the wheeled shoe the most, mostly because of nostalgia, but also because it was very convinient, and was basically a supercharged shoe. But they don't make these anymore and my next favourite one is the skateboard. ( Read the tier list at the end for my reasons, from this point on, I am mainly focusing on skateboarding. Although I might write more about other forms later. )


Recently, I got the chance to skate around town and interact with a lot of skilled skaters. To understand skateboarding, we need to understand surfing and it's place in society. Going back in history, humans were mostly land dwellers with a lot of settlements in and around water. Navigating waterways has been a deep rooted part of human knowledge sharing with research showing that the homo crossed almost 40 mile distance in waterways ~100,000 years ago in the lower paleolithic era. The mode of movement over these waterways were crude boats built with floating wood tied together and animal skin as sails. [1]
