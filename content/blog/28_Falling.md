Why I started skating. How to skate. What I like and how to upgrade your ride.

I have always liked the concept of skating around. When I was very young, me and my brother got a tiny skateboard and a kick scooter which we used to ride around. Even before that, we used to roller skate on a friend's backyard everyday. Then I got a version of heelys with pop open wheels and I used to take it all over.This made me fall in love with the feeling of being on a rolling platform.
