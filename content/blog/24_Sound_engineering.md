I recently signed up for a certification course in sound Engineering. This was a very basic course that taught how to get sound in and out of the DAW ( Digital Audio Workstation )through the Sound system.
To pass the exam ( and get access to the sweet sweet audio studio ) you need to pass 3 modules.

1. Get the Digital audio system configured for the task at hand
2. Get sound from a microphone into the DAW and add an insert or a send to the sound
3. Tie the wire properly.


### Configuring the Digital audio system
