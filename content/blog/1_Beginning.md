There are certain things that will always come back to haunt you for forgetting them.Such things are quite interesting and are from too niche of a field to be found with a simple search. it seems there are things to be found out everyday. so this is a collection of what I have loved and left my mind blown. Mostly engineering breakthroughs or a creative way to edit stuff in blender and some shortcuts for editing software. this is also an endeavour in improving my memory.
