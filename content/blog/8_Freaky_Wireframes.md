Let’s talk about the wireframe modifier. Looks like just another boring modifier but honestly one of the more powerful modifiers available.

It takes a solid object and converts it into another solid mesh with the original object’s edges. The more you difficult the merrier.

The offset value determines if the mesh appears inside or outside the original object, essentially allowing you to create cool effects with a duplicated object along with the original. More cool effects if used with the boolean modifier

The vertex group provides an area in which the modifier is to be applied

Thickness factor determines the sharp or round edges for the new mesh work that is created.

Replace original replaces the original mesh with the created mesh essentially creating a new object.

That’s all there is to know about this particular modifier but not all of it’s applications. One crazy use i found was creatting veins in a leaf. The top modifier on my favourites list only after the wave modifier.
