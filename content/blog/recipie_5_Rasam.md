Whatever happens the most comforting food that I 

### Ingredients

- mustard seeds: 1 teaspoon
- cumin: 1 teaspoon
- dhaniya seeds: 1.5 teaspoons
- Garlic tooth: about 3
- Red chilly: about 2 ( or chilly powder about 1 teaspoon)
- Curry leaves: a bunch
- Coriander: A few leaves
- Tomato: one
- Tamarind: a small lemon sized ( or 3 teaspoons of concentrate )

### Process

This is a straightforward process, but very rewarding if done right.
- Take the cumin, dhaniya seeds, garlic tooth and the red dried chillies and grind them in a mixie. 
    - This will act as the base masala for our rasam
- Now take about 300ml of water in a bowl and add the tamarind paste.
- To this chop the tomatoes into medium sized cubes and add along with the coriander and half of the curry leaves.
- Now Mash this really well with bare hands till the tomatoes are crushed and everything is nicely ground.
- In a new pan, pour some oil and add the mustard seeds. Now pour the paste we made in the first step and heat it just a bit without making it too burnt
- Now pour the water mixture into the pan and heat it in low flame. *Do not heat in high flame to avoid the water boiling too fast*
- After about 5 mins you will feel the aroma, and you can decide to add salt to taste.
- This can now be eaten with rice and appalam in the side
